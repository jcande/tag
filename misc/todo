We can emit "debug" symbols when compiling the w-machine into the tag-system. We can mark certain symbols the correspond to the beginning of a new w-machine instruction and then check for them each step of emulator (perhaps by adding a field to TagRule to show the "source line").

We can translate the assembled symbols (raw numbers) into their symbolic names by emitting the translator lookup table in the haskell source. Perhaps just save it as an ascii (0: "s0_0")-style file when we make the assembled object file.
