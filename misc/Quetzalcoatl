Name of the challenge: Quetzalcoatl's Onion


Take your mind to another level http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1998/SimConEx.98.html






Implement a simple stack based language in the second compiled language
 - maybe forth?
     dup  ( a -- a a )
     drop ( a -- )
     swap ( a b -- b a )
     over ( a b -- a b a )
     rot  ( a b c -- b c a )
This will be buggy
They'll print out data on the left side of the tape (using shellcode in the tag system) to exploit it
