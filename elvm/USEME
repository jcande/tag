Now you have tools such as out/8cc and out/elc

Use following targets to build/run tests for backend xxx:

- `make build-xxx`: Compile all tests to xxx backend
   (e.g., out/lisp.c.eir.xxx will be built from test/lisp.c)
- `make test-xxx` or `make xxx`: Run tests for xxx backend
   (e.g., out/lisp.c.eir.xxx.out.diff will be output)
- `make test-xxx-full`: Run target/xxx.c on ELVM
   (this checks if the target xxx can self-host)
- `make test`: Build and run all tests
   (WARNING: will take a lot of time/disk)
